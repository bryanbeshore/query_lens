**Please do not open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, please report vulnerabilities privately using [GitHub's private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/bryanbeshore/query_lens/security/advisories/new).

You can also email [bryan.beshore@gmail.com](mailto:bryan.beshore@gmail.com) directly.
